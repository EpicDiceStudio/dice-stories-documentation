# Vocabulary

In Dice Stories, several concepts will come into play in more or less hidden ways, depending on your level of use.

As a game master, here are the basic concepts you need to understand:

- Campaigns
- Scenarios
- Systems
- Resources
- Plug-ins

Later, you will see advanced notions such as :

- Blueprints
- Layouts
- Generators
- ...

Back to the basics!

## Campaigns :id=campaigns

A campaign ties all the other notions together. It's mandatory to play.

This is where you can invite players, create scenarios, use a system, launch a game, and so on.

You can define a thumbnail that your players will see on their home page, as well as a background image/video. The background image/video lets you customize the default display of your campaign, which will be used during your games when no content is displayed.

## Scenarios :id=scenarios

A campaign can have several scenarios. A scenario represents a story arc in your game. They are not compulsory, but offer invaluable help to game masters in structuring their stories.

A scenario is divided into Acts. It's in these acts that you can write part of your story, mentioning characters, objects, places, etc., and so on.

## Systems :id=systems

A campaign can have just one system. It's not compulsory, but it can be used to automate games, rules and so on.

In Dice Stories, you can create your own systems entirely on your own, without needing to know anything about development.

## Resources :id=resources

Resources are all the elements of your game. They can be characters, items, spells, skills, cards...

The campaign system makes it easy for you to do all this.

By default, you can already create 2 basic resources: cards and texts. These two resources allow you to distribute combat maps, world maps and texts (notes, hints...) to your players. These resources do not require a system to be created.

You can assign one or more resources to your players (e.g. a character). They can then modify the data in these resources.

## Plug-ins :id=plug-ins

Extensions let you add new features to Dice Stories. By default, you already have several dozen extensions added:

- Text/voice/video chat
- Notes
- Measurement tools
- Media library
- Audio player
- ...

These are the most obvious extensions, but as you build your system, you'll discover many more!
